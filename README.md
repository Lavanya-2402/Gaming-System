ABSTRACT

The Gaming System is a numerical puzzle game designed to challenge players to reach a target number by adding a number within a customizable range to the previous input. The game includes customizable scales, audio feedback, and a simple user interface. The innovative features of the game, such as customizable game modes and multiplayer mode, enhance the overall gaming experience and provide flexibility and variety. The system requirements include a suitable operating system, processor, memory, graphics card, storage, and the installation of Python and Pygame library and the C graphics. The gaming system offers a unique and engaging gameplay experience suitable for players of all ages and skill levels.

Problem Statement: 
Gaming System: Given target T and the scale S, develop a software to play the target-scale game. 

METHODOLOGY

PACKAGES USED-> 

PyGame is a set of Python modules designed for game development, providing functionality such as graphics, sound, and user input handling. It can be used to create 2D games and is widely used in the game development community.
Sys is a built-in Python module that provides access to system-specific parameters and functions. It can be used in game development to exit the game, handle command-line arguments, and access system-specific resources.
Random is another built-in Python module that provides functions for generating random numbers and sequences. It can be used in game development to generate random events, such as enemy positions, loot drops, or level layouts.

CONCEPTS USED->      
There are many concepts used in gaming systems, some of which include:
Game mechanics: The rules and systems that govern gameplay, such as scoring, power-ups, and level design.
Graphics: The use of visual elements, such as images to create an immersive game environment.
Sound design: The use of audio elements, such as music, sound effects to enhance the gameplay experience.
User interface (UI): The design of the interface through which players interact with the game, including buttons, and controls.
Multiplayer functionality: The ability for multiple players to connect and play together in the same game world.
Loops : To repeat the process until an event occurs.
Functions: To break down the code into smaller, more manageable pieces. This makes it easier to read, debug and maintain the code, especially as games can involve a lot of complex logic. For Reusability, modularity and abstraction.

CONCLUSION

In conclusion, the "Gaming System" project is a target scale game that challenges players to reach a numerical target by adding a number within a customizable range to the previous input.
